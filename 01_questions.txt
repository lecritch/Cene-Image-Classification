- For the data generator when importing images, does it matter what the 'target_size' variable is
- Similarily, does it matter what the 'batch_size' is?  How do I determine this?  Does the batch size for train, test, val need to be different?
- Calling predict on my model 2, I'm not sure how to see which images correspond to the predictions - how do I extract the images once I've done the reshaping for the modelling?
