    "The models created here are definitely not the best performing models - we can do better.  Due to time constraints and the extended time it took to run later models, I did not have the chance to apply transfer learning as planned.  Future iterations will definitely include this.  Due to overfitting still being present in the model, I will also experiment with other regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization. "

While the model is still overfitting it is the least amount of overfitting we have seen so far in our modelling.  The validation loss is still erratic in its behaviour and does not show signs of convergence yet.  Investigations into why this is happening and if there is any further data manipulation I could perform will be my next step.  This model was not included in this notebook as I it took 7 hours to run and could not reproduce it in this notebook without rerunning it.  The model has been saved though which you can see in the above-linked notebook.\n",
