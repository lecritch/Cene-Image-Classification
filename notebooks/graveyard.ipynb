    "The models created here are definitely not the best performing models - we can do better.  Due to time constraints and the extended time it took to run later models, I did not have the chance to apply transfer learning as planned.  Future iterations will definitely include this.  Due to overfitting still being present in the model, I will also experiment with other regularization techniques such as L1 and L2 regularization. "
